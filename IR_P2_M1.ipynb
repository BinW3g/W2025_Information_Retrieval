    "The Dataset was downloaded from [here](https://cdn.freesound.org/mtg-jamendo/raw_30s/audio/raw_30s_audio-28.tar). Since no problems with limited resources occured, we chose the full quality data. \n",
    "\n",
    "As first step we chose 20 random files from the dataset. Those files were cut to 10 second audio-snippets using Audacity. All snippets start at a random time within the first 20 seconds of the original track. \n",
    "\n",
    "As second step we modified each snippet in three different ways:\n",
    "- Noise: added noticeable (Gaussian) noise to the snippet\n",
    "- Coding: compressed the snippet highly\n",
    "- Mobile: played the snippet from a laptop and recorded it with a phone with different noises in the background\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves us with four versions of the files: original, noise, coding, mobile. \n",

    "Folder structure: \n",
    "- random_selection_short: 10 second unmodified snippets \n",
    "- random_selection_noise: snippets with noise modification\n",
    "- random_selection_compression: snippets with coding modification\n",
