    "The Dataset was downloaded from [here](https://cdn.freesound.org/mtg-jamendo/raw_30s/audio/raw_30s_audio-28.tar). \n",
    "Since no problems with limited resources occured, we chose the full quality data. \n",
    "\n",
    "As first step we chose 20 random files from the dataset. Those files were cut to 10 second audio-snippets using Audacity. All snippets start at a random time within the first 20 seconds of the original track. \n",
    "\n",
    "As second step we modified each snippet in three different ways:\n",
    "- Noise: added noticeable (Gaussian) noise to the snippet\n",
    "- Coding: compressed the snippet highly\n",
    "- Mobile: played the snippet from a laptop with different background noises and recorded it with a phone\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves us with 4 versions of the files: original, noise, coding, mobile. \n"
